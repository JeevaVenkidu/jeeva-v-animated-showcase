# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to the source code of my personal developer portfolio! This project is entirely built and designed by me, with the strategic support of AI tools to streamline development and enhance code quality.

It showcases who I am, what I build, and how I codeâ€”featuring a modern, clean, and responsive UI.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js**: (Recommended: install via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for easy version management)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
5.  Then, open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.

## Deployment

This portfolio is ideal for free hosting platforms due to its static nature. Some excellent options include:

* **Vercel**: Seamless GitHub integration, free SSL, custom domains.
* **Netlify**: Built-in CI/CD, forms, HTTPS.
* **GitHub Pages**: Easy deployment for static sites (HTML/CSS/JS) directly from your repository.
* **Firebase Hosting**: Ideal for Single Page Applications (SPAs), CLI-based deployment.
* **Render**: Supports static site and backend deployments.
* **Cloudflare Pages**: Superfast CDN, Git integration.
* **Surge**: Easiest CLI-based static hosting.

### Custom Domain Setup

You can configure a custom domain directly through your chosen hosting provider's dashboard (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase).

## How AI Helped Me

While this portfolio is entirely my own creation and customization, I leveraged AI tools to significantly boost my productivity and refine the project:

* **Suggest reusable component structures**: For instance, AI helped me brainstorm effective ways to structure my `ProjectCard` or `ContactForm` components for reusability.
* **Speed up animations and styling logic**: AI assisted in quickly generating complex CSS for hover effects or Framer Motion variants.
* **Refactor and debug faster**: It provided suggestions for cleaner code and helped identify issues more efficiently.
* **Write clearer and consistent documentation**: AI aided in crafting this very `README` and other inline comments.

Ultimately, AI acted as a powerful assistant, but all final decisions, designs, and the overall architecture were entirely my own.
